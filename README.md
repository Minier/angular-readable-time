# angular-readable-time

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wildlyinaccurate/angular-readable-time.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wildlyinaccurate/angular-readable-time)

AngularJS filter for converting a number of seconds to a human-readable time.
This fork is modded to provide more specific output.

## Usage

Include angular-readable-time.js in your application.

```html
<script src="angular-readable-time.js"></script>
```

Add the `readableTime` module to your application's dependencies.

```js
angular.module('myApp', ['readableTime']);
```

Use the filter by passing it a number of seconds.

```html
<p>{{ 60 | readableTime }}</p>
<p>{{ 3738512 | readableTime }}</p>
```

The above example will look something like this:

> 1 minute
>
> 1 month 1 week 5 days 22 hours 28 minutes 32 seconds
